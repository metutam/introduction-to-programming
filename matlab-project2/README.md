1. A new car bought loses its value at a certain rate in each year. The depreciation continues in the form of 3%, 5%, 3%, 5%... (For example, a car bought in 2010 loses its value by 3% of the previous year's value in odd years such as 2011, 2013, 2015, ... Similarly, the same car loses its value by 5% of the previous year's value in even years such as 2012, 2014, 2016, ...) Write a MATLAB program in the form of a script m-file that receives the purchase year of a car through the input command from the user and calculates in how many years the value of this car will fall below 30%.

2. Write a MATLAB program in the form of a script m-file that should receive an integer or a floating-point number with the input command from the user continuously until he/she enters -1 as the inputted data. When your program ends, it should print the followings to the screen:
   - Arithmetic mean of the positive floating-point numbers entered,
   - Harmonic mean of the negative odd integers entered,
   - Geometric mean of the positive even integers entered,
   - The largest negative odd integer entered,
   - The smallest floating-point number entered,
   - Whether the largest number entered is an integer.

3. Write a MATLAB program in the form of a script m-file that must simulate the process of randomly flipping a coin by means of a computer. How many times to flip a coin on the computer must be taken from the user through the input command. When your program ends, it should produce an output similar to what follows:
   - A total of 5 coins were flipped.
   - Number of heads: 1 and its percentage in total flips: 20%
   - Number of tails: 4 and its percentage in total flips: 80%

4. Write a MATLAB program in the form of a script m-file that must take a positive integer named $x$ via the keyboard from the user with the input command and find the factorial of the nearest even number neighbor of $x$ that is not divisible by 5 and is smaller than $x$. You can assume that $x$ is guaranteed not to be evenly divisible by 5.

5. A new employee is given a bonus of 1% of his salary each month. In every 12 months, this employee also receives a 10% salary increase. Write a MATLAB program in the form of a script m-file that must take the number of months during which this new employee works for his company and finds the percentage of his accumulated bonus payments in this period over his first salary.
