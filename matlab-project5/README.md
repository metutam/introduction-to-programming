1. A mobile phone company offers the following plans to its customers:
   | **Plan 1** | **Plan 2** |
   | --- | --- |
   | Fixed Fee: 15 TL | Fixed Fee: 40 TL |
   | The first 200 minutes are free. | The first 200 minutes are free. |
   | The customer is charged 0.25 TL for every minute after the first 200 minutes. | The customer is charged 0.15 TL for every minute after the first 200 minutes. |
   
   Write a MATLAB program in the form of a script m-file that takes the average monthly phone call time in minutes from the user through the input command and finds the most suitable plan for this user. Your program should print the amount that the user should pay for each plan, as well as the most suitable plan, in Turkish Lira to the screen through the fprintf command.
2. Assume that your mother has three different rugs: *a hand-knotted rug*, *a machine-made rug* and *a wool rug*. You are expected to help your mother and find the carpet cleaning company that charges the least amount of money for its service. In the following table, the cleaning prices of the companies by the carpet type (in TL, per square meter) is given.
   | **Company** | **Hand-knotted Rug** | **Machine-made Rug** | **Wool Rug**|
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | K | 10 | 8 | 6 |
   | L | 12 | 6 | 7 |
   | M | 16 | 8 | 5 |
   | N | 10 | 6 | 8 |

   Write a MATLAB program in the form of a script m-file that takes the length and width of each carpet your mother has through the input command and finds the most suitable carpet cleaning company. Your program should print the amount that each company, as well as the least-charging company, bills in Turkish Lira to the screen through the disp command.
3. Write a MATLAB program in the form of a script m-file that takes a four-digit positive number from the user through the input command. Your program is supposed the swap (exchange) the second and the third digits of the entered number and print this modified number to the screen through the fprintf command. If the user does not enter a valid number in the allowed range, your program should terminate by only giving the following message to the screen with the fprintf command:
   > Pijamalı 'hasta' yağız \şoföre\ çabucak %100% güvendi
   
   Example: If the user enters the number 1234 as input, your program must produce 1324 as its output.
4. Write a MATLAB program in the form of a script m-file that simulates the process of randomly rolling a dice by means of a computer. How many times to roll a dice on the computer must be taken from the user through the input command. When your program ends, it should produce an output similar to what follows:
   
   6 dices were rolled.\
   Number of odd-valued dices: 2\
   Number of even-valued dices: 4
